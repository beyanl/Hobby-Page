      <p class="intro ">
      
        Thanks to Tiktok and Gen Z, reading is now 'cool' but I remember the days when reading instead of playing 'it' with friends was considered being a loser. 
        That's how far back my love of reading goes to, back when you'd get teased for reading. 
        I have been a book worm for as long as I can remember.
        My earliest memories are of reading and my favourite school memories were of my teacher who encouraged me to read and write. 
        To this day, you can find me lost in a version of a world that only exists in my head.

      <h1 class="fave"> Favourite World's to Enter </h1>

      <ul class="genre">
        <li> Romance - because I am a hopeful romantic that obviously want my standards to be through the roof </li>
        <li> Dystopia - because reality clearly isn't scary enough </li>
        <li> Fantasy - because sometimes I need a break from humans </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h1 class="top-picks"> Top picks</h1>

        <div class="top-picks-list">

          <p class="child"> *In no particular order </p>
      
          <ul>
            <li> A Woman is No Man </li>
            <li> A Thousand Splendid Suns </li>
            <li> Eleanor Oliphant </li>
            <li> Before the Coffee Gets Cold </li>
            <li> All her Rage </li>
          </ul>
        
          <p> *Disclaimer, none of those books are in my fave genres, they were just gut wrenchlingly sad which for some reason puts it in my top picks. <br>
          More tears = better book (which says a lot about me!)
          </p>

        </div>

        <h1 class="new"> World's I'm Entering This Year </h1>
      

          <p class="newme">
            New year, same old me but I do want to venture out and read new genres. 
            One genre I'm excited to explore is Mystery and Sci-Fiction (Severance on Apple+ TV has made me want more but in book form).
            Also want to delve more into non-fiction, particlaurly Intersectional Feminism and finally make a dent in my never ending To Be Read list.
