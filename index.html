    <p>
      My childhood memories are quite blurred and I don't remember much. I do however, remember always being lost in a book. <br>
      Till this day, you can find me "bingeing" on a book, basically sitting for hours in one place lost in a book surrounded by snacks.

    <div>
      <h1> My fave genres </h1>

      <ul>
        <li> Romance (so I can stay a hopeful romantic) </li>
        <li> Dystopia (because reality clearly isn't scary enough) </li>
        <li> Fantasy (sometimes humans are too much to deal with) </li>
        </ul>
      
        <h1> Top picks</h1>
        <h3> I can't call them favourites because it's like asking me to pick my favourite child </h3>
      
        <ul>
          <li> A Woman is No Man </li>
          <li> A Thousand Splendid Suns </li>
          <li> Eleanor Oliphant </li>
          <li> Before the Coffee Gets Cold </li>
          <li> All her Rage </li>
        </ul>
      
        <p> disclaimer, none of those books are in my top fave genres, they were just gut wrenchlingly sad which for some reason puts it in my top books. <br>
          More tears = better book
